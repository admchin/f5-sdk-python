F5 SDK (Python) documentation
====================

Introduction
============

This project provides a use case focused python SDK for interacting with F5 products.  The UX closely mirrors established, successful SDK's such as the Azure, AWS, and Google SDK's.

You can interact with BIG-IP and F5 Cloud Services to perform actions such as install/configure the extension components (AS3, TS, DO, etc.), configure an F5 cloud services subscription and much more.
